# Vulkan-Tutorial.com

This is a go port of the example code at vulkan-tutorial.com, 
 using vkng as a wrapper library.  Each subfolder pertains to a
 single step of the tutorial, and I have tried to strike a balance
 between making the tutorial code match the C++ code as closely
 as possible while still being vaguely idiomatic.  You should
 be able to use the code files here as a reference while working
 through the vulkan tutorial.
